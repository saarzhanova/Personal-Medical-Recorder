## Introduction
The personal medical recorder aims to bridge gaps in healthcare access by offering individuals a way to document and organize their medical history. The app supports users in:
- Tracking diseases and symptoms, including adding notes and details.
- Managing a medical calendar for recording daily health observations.
- Setting reminders for medications, doctor appointments, and other health-related events.

Designed with usability in mind, the prototype offers a visual and functional representation of the app's potential as a personal health management tool.

## Features
- **Medical Record Management**: Store and view detailed information about diseases, symptoms, and treatments.
- **Health Tracking Calendar**: Daily notes on health status and reminders for medication or appointments.
- **Symptom History**: Track recurring symptoms, identify trends, and observe health patterns over time.
- **Profile and Disease Cards**: Access a user profile page and individual disease cards with details on treatment progress and contraindications.

## Technologies Used
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) – Front-end framework for building responsive interfaces.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) – CSS framework for styling and layout.
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS
